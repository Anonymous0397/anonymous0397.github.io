This is a test website. The website layout was created as a test using repl.it, specific elements will be updated.

This website is still in development. I may tweak some more stuff but for the time being, the website is still in development
If you want to download the files yourself, feel free to! But please do not claim it as yours.

Remember, I did not create the website myself, I used AI


Update 03.12.2025
I am developing my own version without using AI since I now know some HTML (only the foundation of it but yeah)
So please expect the website to have basic UI elements. Thank you.

__**USELESS INFO**__

The minimum Android version that the website works on when using the stock browser (not Chrome) is Android 4.4
