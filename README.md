~~This is a test website. The website layout was created as a test using repl.it, specific elements will be updated.~~

~~This website is still in development. I may tweak some more stuff but for the time being, the website is still in development~~
~~If you want to download the files yourself, feel free to! But please do not claim it as yours.~~

~~Remember, I did not create the website myself, I used AI~~

**Only on anonymous0397.github.io/legacy/**


Update 03.12.2025
I am developing my own version without using AI since I now know some HTML (only the foundation of it but yeah)
So please expect the website to have basic UI elements. Thank you.

__**USELESS INFO**__

The minimum Android version that the website works on when using the stock browser (not Chrome) is Android 4.4

__Why did I switch from AI to simply using my brain?__

You can't have AI to do everything for you especially making a design. If you prompt AI to do something and you want it to be somethign that you're thinking of, you can't expect AI to do that for you, you need to do this yourself.
